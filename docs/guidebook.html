        <h2>Introduction to Ana-pana-sati</h2>
        <p>Today, I'll be introducing a meditation practice called <strong>Ana-pana-sati</strong>, which comes from the Buddhist tradition. The term Ana-pana-sati means "awareness of breathing" and that's exactly what this practice is focused on.</p>
        
        <p>In this type of meditation, the only thing we focus on is the breath. The goal is to become fully present with the breath and gently return to it whenever our thoughts start to wander. We simply observe our natural breathing, the inhale and the exhale.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="guide-section">
        <h2>Benefits of This Practice</h2>
        <p>Ana-pana-sati is known for its ability to calm the mind and body. By focusing on our breath, we give our brain the space to slow down. Over time, this reduces stress and anxiety. Additionally, this balances emotional and sleep regulation, as well as increasing concentration, creativity, clarity, increasing energy, and much more.</p>
        
        <p>The body also responds, as we relax, we naturally release tension in areas like the face (especially the inner corner of our eyes), jaw, shoulders, and even the chest, which are common places where stress builds up.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="guide-section">
        <h2>Proper Posture</h2>
        <p>Before starting, it's important to sit in a cross-legged position and to clasp both hands together, laying it on the lap. This posture does more than just help us stay still, when you sit this way, your body forms a shape that resembles an infinity symbol, which represents the continuous and balanced flow of energy throughout the body. This alignment can help deepen your focus and enhance the calming effects of the practice, especially during times of stress.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="guide-section">
        <h2>Important Guidelines</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>During meditation, it is important to keep your eyes closed at all times.</li>
          <li>You are allowed to move around but make sure to keep your hands clasped and eyes closed.</li>
          <li>The most important part about this practice is that you are comfortable.</li>
          <li>When the meditation is finished make sure to rub both palms together and cup your eyes as this grounds and brings awareness back to the body.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="guide-section">
        <h2>Accessibility</h2>
        <p>While this meditation has roots in Buddhism, it is accessible to everyone. It doesn't require any spiritual or religious beliefs. So during today's session, I invite you to simply breathe and observe. If your mind starts to wander, and it probably will, just bring your attention back to your breath, calmly and without judgment.</p>

            <span class="time">Start (0:00)</span>
            <p>Let's begin by gently closing our eyes and sitting in a comfortable position, with our hands crossed, resting on our lap.</p>
            <p>Take a deep breath in… and slowly breathe out.</p>
            <p>Let's start by relaxing our body, especially our shoulders, jaw, and the space around the eyes. These are the areas where we tend to hold the most tension.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="script-entry">
            <span class="time">2:40</span>
            <p>Now, begin to gently bring your attention to your natural breath.</p>
            <p>Feel it as it flows in and out through the nose.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="script-entry">
            <span class="time">4:10</span>
            <p>If your mind starts to wander, that's okay. Just notice that it's drifted and softly guide it back to your breath.</p>
            <p>Back to this inhale and this exhale.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="script-entry">
            <span class="time">6:30</span>
            <p>Keep your focus on the breath, the way it enters through the nose and the way it leaves.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="script-entry">
            <span class="time">11:40</span>
            <p>Let go of thoughts of the past and the future, as both are out of your control right now.</p>
            <p>All you need to do is focus on your breath, the one constant thing in your life.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="script-entry">
            <span class="time">15:00</span>
            <p>When you feel ready, bring your awareness back to your body.</p>
            <p>Place your hands softly over your eyes and slowly open them when you're ready, taking in the space around you.</p>
